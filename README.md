This is super easy to set up. All you have to do is create a GitHub repo that matches the pattern of this one: `<prefix>.github.io`. You will then have a website at `<prefix>.github.io` rendering index.html. If you don't want to build your static website by hand, an alternative is to use something like [Jekyll][jekyll] (the static website generator that built this).

The quick-start instructions on the static website generator you choose should help you out with that. From there, you can actually just write all the content for your website in markdown for Jekyll if you go that route (the stuff that you usually find in README.md s). Check out the docs of the static website generator of your choice for more info. I didn't style this thing at all or add any JavaScript, but those are options as well. This project didn't need it.
